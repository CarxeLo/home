		<h2>Types of Power Supplies</h2>
		<p>
			There are three general types of power supply units on the market today, linear, switching, and battery. An important distinction that should be made is that these are methods of how the AC current is converted and 
			changed into the DC current. This type of categorization of power supplies is for specifying the method of conversion and not necessarily the make, model or wattage. Below is a table illustrating the advantages and diadvantages of each method.

		<h2>How to Choose the Right PSU</h2>
		<p>
			Choosing the right model of power supply can be confusing if your haven't done your research. But there are few details to keep in mind.

		<h3 id="wattage">Wattage</h3>
		<p>
			For most people, a 600W power supply is ample power for their PC and peripherals to run smoothly
			However, most people think that more is better. Itâ€™s true that more wattage can allow the computer to do more, but they are much more expensive and there is simply no need to spend extra money on a PSU that is not suitable for its purposes.
			To figure out your exact needs, because they can differ from user to user, you can use a <a href="https://outervision.com/power-supply-calculator">PSU calculator.</a>
		</p>
		<h3 id="efficient">Efficiency</h3>
		<p>
			When purchasing a PSU, consider the efficiency of the unit. More efficient models will save you money in the long run by lowering your cooling bills as well as your energy consumption bills. However, these models are more expensive than other units in their initial purchase prices.
			Another advantage is that they tend to work faster than less efficient models. Try to look for PSUs that have an "80 plus" certificate. This means that only 20 percent of energy is being lost, while at least 80 percent is being put to work. 
		</p>
		<h3 id="size">Size</h3>
		<p>
			One minor factor you might want to look in is the size of your PSU. Larger PSUs have larger components such as fans and heatsinks, which are more effective in cooling than lightweight, smaller models. 
			Larger PSUs are more reliable, quieter and have better air flow throughout the machine.

		</p>
		<h3 id="manu">Manufacturer</h3>
		<p>
			A key factor in choosing your ideal power supply is finding a reliable manufacturer that provides good quality components, a reasonable warranty, and helpful technical support. These are good indicators of the product and of the service you will receive if you purchase from them.
			Some examples of reliable manufacturers, that many people prefer, are Seasonic and Corsair. Though, you should still do your own reasearch as well to get a broader view of the options available to you. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Choosing a PSU can be difficult sometimes, but if you do sufficient research and match your requirements to the capabilities offered by the components, it can become a lot easier. 
			One tip is to ask questions when purchasing. If there is anything you would like clarification or more detail about, please ask the sales associates. They will most likely be willing to answer any questions regarding your concerns.

		<h2>The Future of Power Supply Units</h2>
		<p>
			Power supply units have come a long way since their humble beginnings in 1958. As technology continues to advance forward, PSU components will continue to get better like they did in the 1970s. Inductors, transistors, and capacitors will be able to store more energy, process larger voltage 
			currents and be smaller than before. Another area where many developer are looking however, is the impact on the environment. Large energy consumption leads to pollution of all sorts including air, water and land. Developers are contiuing to find better methods of power converting to reduce 
			or even eliminate as much pollution as they can. With computer use incrasing each day, pollution becomes a large issue that threatens the livability of the planet. Even though energy pollution is not the worst offender in terms of global warming and environmental issues, it still does contribute
			to the problem. However, we aren't there yet. With time and further development, PSUs will become more efficient and better for the planet.
