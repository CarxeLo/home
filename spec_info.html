		<h3>The Early Stages of Switching Power Supplies</h3>
		<p>
			Since switching power supplies are the most advanced type of PSUs we have today, let’s start from the very beginning of switching power supplies.
			The idea behind switching PSUs has been around since the 1930s, however, no one really built upon these concepts until the 1950s. 
			In 1958, a company called IBM had just built its IBM 704 model computer. This was a very early version of a data processing machine or computer at the time.

			The IBM 704 used a switching regulator, which changes between AC and DC currents constantly. This switching regulator is the basis for the switching power supply units we know today. 
			The first switching power supply units on the market were developed by a company called Pioneer Magnetics in 1958. Later another company known as General Electric would break on the scene, contributing their own design of a switching power supply. 
			During the 1960s, the development of power supplies took off extremely fast, as NASA was a driving force behind it. NASA at the time was using the technology in switching power supplies for satellites because it provided efficient power regulations and conversion in a small containment unit. 
			A few years later, nearing the 1970s, switching power supplies became widely popular in computer use. Companies like IBM, Univac, Honeywell, and RCA became well known brand names during this period for its use of switching regulators. Essentially, the indicating factor if a company had reliable technology was if they had computers that used a switching power supply.
			Starting in 1974, more and more adaptations were being developed by companies to be put in minicomputers and other information processing machines. The company, HP, was a significant player during the mid-70s, bringing in some of the newest versions of switching power supplies to the mass market.
			During this period, many articles and reviews were written about this innovation, with many praising it for its efficiency.

		<h3>Moving Forward</h3>
		<p>
			One of the great developers who made strides in this field was Robert Boschert. He quit his job to work on building computer parts, mainly focusing on how to make switching power supplies simpler. He was very successful at this, becoming a CEO of a company with over 650 people. 
			But one factor aided developers to improve this type of technology so rapidly. This was the advancement of transistors. Transistors were getting better and faster every few months, making it easier for developers to include them in their latest power supply designs.
			After transistors became more efficient, the demand for them skyrocketed to a new level after the 1970s. 
			Another company had also just entered the scene, making a lasting impression on consumers.
			The Apple company released its version of a computer in 1977, with fanless power switching and small size, known as the Apple II computer. 
			This was designed by Apple employee Fredrick Rodney Holt and was called revolutionary by Steve Jobs himself. However, in reality, Apple was actually somewhat behind other companies like IBM and Robert Boschert’s company. Despite this, this model of power supplies was used by many of the computers released by Apple, starting with the Apple III, all the way to the Mac 128K.

			By 1981, IBM had launched its first PC model ever. This computer had a 63.6W power supply that was controlled by an IC power controller. These types of power supplies had been gaining popularity since the late 1970s.
			This would be the beginning of the AT power supply that became quite mainstream until 1995, when Intel released their computer models that had an ATX specified motherboard along with its ATX power supply. Ever since then, the ATX power supply has become the standard for all general use computers. 
			Though the ATX power supply has undergone some modifications and changes since its debut in 1995. As computers became more complex, more power was needed to accomplish these tasks. So a voltage regulator module, also known as a VRM, was implemented to the function of an ATX power supply. This allowed the voltage of an AC or DC current to be stepped down, while still maintaining a constant current.
			Today, the main concern around power supplies is their efficiency. Inefficient power supplies can cause harm to the environment, so developers are continuing to find better power supply methods even in the present day.
